# **Sparx Storer**

A simple python tkinter application that stores your answers to avoid failing [sparx bookwork checks](https://support.sparx.co.uk/docs/what-are-bookwork-checks#:~:text=Bookwork%20codes,the%20position%20within%20the%20task).

# Download

Raw python files included for ease of use in school. I might make a .exe file at some point.

Download the current version [here](https://github.com/harcher-dev/sparxStorer/raw/main/sparxStorer-v3.3.py?raw=true).

Raw version can be found [here](https://github.com/harcher-dev/sparxStorer/raw/main/sparxStorer-v3.3.py) if you are having issues with the github version.

# New Features

Saving system - a button that saves all of your bookwork codes into a file in a nice and neat format in case you need to save your codes for a later date

Stealth mode - make the window smaller and changes the colour of everything to grey
Enter key functionality - instead of clicking submit, if you're lazy enough, you can press enter on your keyboard

# Requirements

All you need is the base version of python. I used tkinter which is a pre-installed module for python so all you need to do is copy and paste the code into a file and run it.
